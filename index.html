            	My name is Brady Norum and I am a computer science student at Hofstra University, 
            	with a concentration in web and mobile engineering and a minor in math. 
            	I graduate in Spring of 2025, and am currently looking for an internship for
            	before or after I graduate. I'm passionate about making the web navigable for 
            	creators and those looking to advertise in a digital space. I also have interests
            	in the fields of design and digital art.
	        	<br><br>
	            Outside of computer science, I constantly find myself online. In the past, I have found myself
              managing social media, and posting my art online. I take commission for graphic design, 
              and have worked with companies like Thermo Fisher Scientific and The Lawrence Herbert School 
              of Communication. As an amatuer musician, I learn from the internet, and just use it to enjoy 
              music. My favorite artist is Steely Dan. I'm probably the biggest Steely Dan fan. Since I was 
              a kid, I've been really into video games, and recently decided I've had enough of playing them,
              and decided to start making them.
            <br><br>
              I like to consider myself an artist first, and an everything-else second.
              Recently, I've been incredibly lucky to break ground on projects with a bunch of
              people, which have allowed me to push my skill as an artist even further. I'm excited
              to show the world what I can do.
            <br><br>
