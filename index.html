          <p>
            	My name is Brady Norum and I am a computer science student at Hofstra University, 
            	with a concentration in web and mobile engineering and a minor in math. 
            	I graduate in Spring of 2025, and am currently looking for an internship for
            	before or after I graduate. I'm passionate about making the web navigable for 
            	creators and those looking to advertise in a digital space. I also have interests
            	in the fields of design and digital art.
	        	<br><br>
	        Outside of computer science, I constantly find myself online. At Hofstra, 
                I manage social media for our campus television show 
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/directorscuthu/"  target="_blank">Director's Cut</a>.
		This is one of my major creative outlets as a digital artist.
		As an amatuer musician, I learn from the internet, and just use it to enjoy 
		music. My favorite artist is Steely Dan. I'm probably the biggest Steely Dan fan.
	        	<br><br>
		I like to consider myself an artist first, and an everything-else second.
		Recently, I've been incredibly lucky to break ground on projects with a bunch of
		people, which have allowed me to push my skill as an artist even further. I'm excited
		to show the world what I can do.
