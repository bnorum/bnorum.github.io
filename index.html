              My name is Brady Norum and I am a computer science student at Hofstra University, 
              with a concentration in web and mobile engineering and a minor in math. 
             	I graduate in Spring of 2025, and am currently looking for an internship for
            	before or after I graduate. I'm passionate about making the web navigable for 
            	creators and those looking to advertise in a digital space. I also have interests
            	in the fields of design and digital art.
	              <br><br>
	            Outside of computer science, I constantly find myself online. At Hofstra, 
              I manage social media for our campus television show 
              <a href="https://www.instagram.com/directorscuthu/"  target="_blank">Director's Cut</a>.
		          This is one of my major creative outlets as a digital artist.
		          As an amatuer musician, I learn from the internet, and just use it to enjoy 
		          music. My favorite artist is Steely Dan. I'm probably the biggest Steely Dan fan.
		          I'm also a writer, and plan to publish prose online soon.
