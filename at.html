        <p>
          Last week, I completed a section hike of the Appalachian
          Trail which took me from North Adams, on the Vermont border of
          Massachusetts, down to Salisbury, on the Massachusetts border of
          Connecticut. This covers about 105 miles of trail and is particularly
          hilly, though not nearly as elevated as other parts of the trail. I'm
          writing this for the clarity and interest of those who have been
          curious about what I've been doing along the way. But before I discuss
          the trip itself, here is a little about my gear.
        </p>

        <h2>Gear</h2>

        <p>
          As seen from my beautiful drawing on the Travelodge notepad, I did in
          fact bring gear. This was my first major trip and I definitely
          overpacked, so I'll go over some staples, and some stuff that was
          useless.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trifecta of sleeping pad, sleeping bag, tent, are some of the most
          important components of your bag, and interestingly the most varied
          among hikers. My set-up is VERY budget friendly, so compared to the
          regular Zpacks and Big Agnes Andys on the trail, I was hauling weight.
          My
          <a
            href="https://www.rei.com/product/217592/rei-co-op-trailmade-20-sleeping-bag"
            >sleeping bag</a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://www.rei.com/product/243610/rei-co-op-trailmade-1-tent-with-footprint"
            >tent</a
          >
          are both REI, and my pad is the cheapest piece of foam on Amazon. I'm
          not even linking it because I've already replaced it. My sleeping pad
          was held on the outside of my pack. It got so, so dirty. Definitely
          pick up something with a cover. Foam is really hard to clean.
          <br /><br />
          Curiously, my pack is also REI, but I bought it off of an old dude on
          marketplace for 50 bucks. It's super old, and lacks a lot of the
          fanciness of modern packs. There's no where to put a water bottle,
          except inside the pack or in your hand. The belts can be hard to
          tighten, as can the cinches. It's also pretty heavy. But it looks
          cool.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Turns out, everything is just squeezing.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          For my water filter I went with the
          <a href="https://www.sawyer.com/product/squeeze-water-filter-system"
            >Sawyer Squeeze</a
          >. I was treated with a weird kind of respect on the trail for using
          my original pouches that came with the Sawyer, which people tend to
          worry will break on them (remember this). I found the Sawyer to be
          great, and I got used to the taste of water really fast. When I
          started, I actually drank water directly out of the filter, rather
          than putting it in a water bottle first. The technique was a little
          ridiculous, as I had to lift the bag over my head everytime I wanted
          to drink. I, at best, looked like a hydrated idiot. <br /><br />
          My pack ended up being about 33 pounds with food. This comes out to be
          somewhat average for hikers, but I could definitely get down to 30 by
          scrapping some useless stuff. I carried around a shovel for the entire
          time, and only used it once, and brought some pretty sponge-like
          clothes. Shoot for 30, if it's your first trip.
          <br /><br />
          A quick aside before jumping off of gear, just to talk about stuff I
          wish I had. First, a pillow would be nice, I've heard good things
          about a couple brands, particularly the
          <a
            href="https://www.nemoequipment.com/products/fillo-backpacking-pillow"
            >Nemo Fillo</a
          >
          and the
          <a
            href="https://cascadedesigns.com/products/compressible-pillow-cinch"
            >Thermarest Compressible</a
          >. I've never actually tried out a camp pillow, so I have to do that
          to figure out if they're worth it, but my hope is that they feel good.
          I also found myself jealous of other people's bags regularly, so I'll
          be looking into ways to modify my current one to better suit my needs.

        <h2>First Days</h2>
        <figure>

          <figcaption>Mount Prospect ledge, 2497'.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Turns out, backpacking while unprepared is actually pretty hard. I
          gave myself a period of about two weeks to train, and went for day
          hikes of around five miles every other day. This was not enough. When
          I got about half a mile in, I knew that I was going to quit before the day was over.
          <br /><br />
          The first day was particularly hard. I travelled about ten miles (more
          than I had ever hiked ever, probably), and got up to a ledge on
          Prospect (seen above). Following this, I went twenty minutes in the
          wrong direction, and ended up getting to camp at around 9PM. Whoops.
          This was by far my quietest day. It seems the bubble of hikers from
          Springer had not reached my area yet, and I wouldn't see hikers in
          droves until a little under a week in, when I would reach Upper Goose
          Pond.
          <br /><br />
          After the first day I woke up to rain. This weather would make day two
          end very short. I travelled a little over four miles. I have a lot of
          excuses for this, I swear. First, yesterday was a lot of mileage for
          someone as out of shape as me. Second, this was Williams and Greylock,
          the highest elevation in Massachusetts. Third, it was pouring. Fourth, I was scareddddd. Along
          the way, I would meet a few people. First was two old women who gave
          me some water and a hard boiled egg. Thanks! Second was a guy who I
          had seen doing a day hike the day prior, and would see day hiking on
          day 3 as well, which was odd. Third was my first hiker-hiker, named No
          Filter.
          <br /><br />
          No Filter and I met at the emergency shelter at the top of Greylock.
          He was in his 50s, and from Malden (which he didn't need to tell me, I
          knew). We both got stuck at the top of Greylock, because the rain was
          too hard to safely get down. In an attempt to make the most of it, we
          started a fire in the fireplace in the emergency shelter. No Filter
          may well have been a wizard, because I swear the wood was wet when I
          got in there. At this point, we also found toilet paper and vodka very
          handy. For fire, not for food and drink. The fire raised the
          temperatures in the shelter just enough to almost dry my wet clothes.

        <p>
          Greylock was very complicated for me. For a lot of people, it's the
          highlight of Massachusetts, for me, it kind of blew. When I got to the
          top, I was relieved and excited to get to the lodge, only to find out
          it was closed, which is how me and No Filter ended up in the emergency
          shelter. We made the most of it, but Greylock's characteristic views
          couldn't be seen. The best part was the next morning, when the lodge
          opened and they served breakfast, which was great and cheap. There, I
          would meet my first thru hiker, Kaleidoscope. He was crazy, telling us
          about his consistent 25-30 mile days. He was a few days ahead of the
          rest of the bubble, so it was clear that his mileage was adding up. I
          would also go on to see him in every subsequent hiker log I checked
          going southbound. He signs his name in rainbow pen.
          <br /><br />
          It was also on Greylock where I would recieve my trail name, after the
          previously mentioned old women and No Filter seperately suggested that
          the location I hold my towel (see drawing above) was reminiscent of a
          sumo wrestler. Hence the name: Sumo.
          <br /><br />
          Leaving Greylock about a mile in, I cramped my knee, really bad. I was
          able to limp about half of a mile to a street. Luckily, there is a
          large network of shuttle drivers in the Berkshires ready to pick you
          up within an hour. I got picked up by Cindy, an old woman driving a
          Subaru with a busted manifold, who was still managing to go 60 in a
          30. She dropped me off where I would camp next, so I effectively
          missed about five miles of the trail from Greylock to Cheshire. She,
          along with all of the shuttle drivers I would go on to meet, are
          experts in the surrounding area, both in regards to hiking, as well as
          everything else. If you needed any kind of item, they could take you
          to where it is sold.
          <br /><br />
          Father Tom's Campsite, where I spent the remainder of day three, was a
          very nice campsite situated in the center of the puny town of
          Cheshire. Cheshire has three attractions, a gas station, a Dollar
          General, and a restaurant. The campsite, kept together by a local
          church, had several amenities, including bikes. I'm confident the bike
          fixed my knee. I could barely walk so I biked everywhere, and biked
          for leisure. It was a lot of fun.
          <br /><br />
          I also ate at a restaurant! This quickly became one of my favorite
          things on the trail (some dedicated hikers hate it). Stopping and
          eating is incredibly satisfying here, because every calorie counts,
          and you get to experience a little bit of local life. It was here I
          made a habit of getting a beer in every town I'm in.
        </p>
        <h2>Dalton and Beyond</h2>
        <p>
          After a bit of hiking and a brief stop at Crystal Mountain campsite, I
          had made it to Dalton without any major issues. Dalton is sick. I
          somehow came out of town spending twenty dollars, after getting a
          burger, fries, two beers, two Smartwaters, some chips, and ice cream.
          I don't know how this happened. I unfortunately missed a legend, Tom
          Levardi, who is a notorious Trail Angel whose house is on the trail.
          He was out to lunch. I did, however, meet a group at the bar, who were
          headed up to Vermont that day (!!), about a 25 mile distance, at 2PM.
          I don't get how some do it.
        </p>

          <figcaption>The church in question.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Dalton is an excellent town. There's a really cool church, a dam,
          many, many gas stations. Basically, everything a hiker needs. I made
          the mistake of only doing a small restock here, although I did restock
          prior in Cheshire. I just got what seemed good, which meant I only had
          about three days of food.
          <br /><br />
          This would be where I abandoned my drinking technique. This is because
          I found one of my squeeze bags had a hole in it (I told you to
          remember). This meant that at this point I would've only been able to
          carry one liter on me at all times. I ended up joining the horde of
          hikers who use Smart Water bottles. They're really handy. I don't know
          what I was thinking the first few days just slamming down Sawyer straw
          water.
          <br /><br />
          Leaving Dalton, I had another three miles before the next campsite,
          Kay Wood. This was surprisingly tame. Suprisingly, only because this
          was the day that I walked the most, at about nineteen miles. I felt
          very good! Until the following day. That day, I got in about nine
          miles, which was my average. My feet were killing me. My feet are
          still killing me, and its been over ten days. Since I've finished,
          I've been walking like I just learned how to. In any event, I
          traversed Warner Hill. I was so worn out I didn't even stop to take a
          picture! So no picture! Imagine Warner Hill!
          <br /><br />
          The best part of this day was that I was able to ask a passing hiker
          for Ibuprofen, and he gave me some. It helped a lot. There is an
          endless amount of kindness on the AT. If you ask a hiker for
          something, there's a very high chance you'll get it. The people of the
          Berkshires love hikers. Many, affectionately called Trail Angels, will
          bring supplies to the trail for hikers to take. It varies from beer to
          painkillers to burgers. The wilderness is a calorie desert for a group
          of ravenously hungry people, and Trail Angels supplement that.
          <br /><br />
          On the topic of Trail Angels, I finished this day at the house of the
          Cookie Lady. The Cookie Lady got her name from giving free cookies and
          tea to all hikers who come by her house. She provides other amendities
          as well, like a bathroom, water, shelter. I ended up staying at her
          place, in an airplane hangar where they keep farm equipment. I didn't
          get a picture of the layout of the hangar, but I'll provide a picture.
          It was six "bedrooms," seperated by cubicle dividers. There were no
          overhead lights, so it was constantly dark and I had to equip my
          headlamp. It also had the distinct smell of hikers. The beds were not
          for sleeping <i>in</i>, rather they were for sleeping <i>on</i>. I put
          my sleeping pad and bag on top of the bed. It was comfortable, but I
          missed beds.

        <p>
          A few more things about the Cookie Lady: She had two dogs, who chilled
          out on the farm. If you couldn't make a donation, you could work on
          the farm for a day to earn your bed. She told me to look out for a man
          named Hawk, who had done the trail eight times, and was shooting for
          ten.
          <br /><br />
          I left at around 7AM. This meant that I narrowly missed
        </p>
        <h2>The World's Fastest Hiker</h2>
        <p>
          My trip coincided with the world record attempt for the fastest known
          time (or, FKT) of the Appalachian Trail. It was being attempted by a
          gentleman named
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kelly_(runner)"
            >John Kelly</a
          >, a data scientist. At this point, he had been hiking for about 25
          days, and had gone 1550 miles. <br /><br />
          John Kelly is a speciman among specimen. For one, he was consistently
          doing 50 mile days on the trail. On top of this, he was only sleeping
          three hours a night. He is, in all respects, a machine that turns
          resolve into mileage. We talked a lot about John Kelly on the trail.
          <i>Everyone</i> was following him. If you needed to start a
          conversation over camp dinner, he was the easiest pick. A lot of the
          conversations boiled down to how much respect everyone has for Tara
          Dower, the current record holder. <br /><br />
          The controversial part of John Kelly is the amount of support he has.
          He consistently has two pacers, he slackpacks (or, has his bag
          delivered to the next campsite every day), and he seems to have the
          entire universe on his side. Of course, this was the case for Tara,
          but John seems to have some sort of technlogical edge to him.
          <br /><br />
          Unfortunately, as of writing this, John Kelly sustained an injury to
          his ankle and has abandoned the attempt. Personally, I was
          indifferent, but a lot of hikers have varying opinions about his run,
          and whether or not they wanted Tara to keep the record. A John Kelly
          record would certainly open the gates for other runners to challenge
          the record, which would've been really cool to see. Though, I get the
          feeling he is far from done with this.
        </p>
        <h2>Brady Norum Takes a Break</h2>
        <p>
          After leaving the Cookie Lady's house, I hustled a good distance
          because I was truly excited for my next stopping point, Upper Goose
          Pond. This site is famous for having a federally-owned cabin run by
          volunteers who serve pancakes and coffee in the morning. To get there,
          I had to cross Becket Mountain, as well as make my way around a lake
          or two. Neither was particularly bad, but I think I ended up leaving a
          water bottle on Becket. Whoops.
          <br /><br />
          Also on Becket, I got a minor spoiler for the rest of my journey. At
          the summit, I met two people, who happened to be the cabin volunteers.
          They told me to go slow, because we were on our way to the same place,
          and they had to unlock the cabin. They didn't need to tell me. My
          slowness is completely self-imposed. Going down Becket was nice,
          because I knew it would be the last elevation change before Upper
          Goose Pond.
          <br /><br />
          The end of Becket coincided with my exact half-way point on the trail,
          which was the Massachusetts Turnpike, Interstate-90. This route runs
          directly through the center of Massachusetts, which means it was at
          about the 48 mile mark. Following I-90, it turns out I had to go up
          again. Always check your topographic map. There is a nature boundary
          which is a couple hundred steep feet which you go up, then immediately
          down.
          <br /><br />
          It wasn't too bad (this is a lie). After this, it was a quick walk to
          Upper Goose Pond. There, I would meet several thru hikers. Among
          them were Nature Boy, Metro, Alpha-Gal, and an old Scottish dude that
          I never got the name of. There were tons of people here, about two
          dozen. I slept in my tent rather than the cabin, because the next
          three days were the hottest of the year, and there is no AC in the
          remote cabin. The Feds can pay for pancakes, but not air conditioning.
          <br /><br />
          On top of enjoying the boons of the cabin and the company of the
          others, I took a swim. One thing I've left out so far is how dirty I
          was. I brought baby wipes in an attempt to keep myself clean, but it
          only goes so far. Swimming in the lake was as clean as I could get for
          now.

        The morning was great. I was woken up by rain, and the sounds of 24
        hikers frantically disassembling their tents because they don't wanna
        carry four pounds of rain on them. Hikers wake up early because there's
        nothing to do after 7PM in the woods, so breakfast started at 5:30AM. I
        wanted the NOBOs to get their food first, so I waited a while for
        pancakes, but it was worth it. They were really great. The coffee was
        perfect. I was tired of instant coffee, as was everyone else. We all
        wanted regular duration coffee, and we got it.
        <br /><br />
        After breakfast, everyone left. Obviously, but they left realllllly
        quickly. Everyone was gone in ten minutes. Considering these were the
        hottest days of the year, I decided to (mostly) take a day off in the
        city of Lee. The night prior, I walked half a mile to the closest place
        with signal, and booked a room at the Pilgrim Inn, and made an agreement
        with a shuttle driver, Heidi, to pick me up at noon on Route 20, next to
        the turnpike. This, of course, meant I had to backtrack over the
        previously-complained-about nature boundary. It was just as pleasurable
        the second time.
        <br /><br />
        Heidi was hilarious. She was very Tim Robinson-like. She also happened
        to manage the hotel I was staying at. The shuttle rides are always fun.
        You go through a city where this person lives, and they comment on every
        single building, and describe an event that has happened to them there.
        Heidi was nice enough to point out the store that her neighbor broke
        into!
        <br /><br />
        Berkshire towns are all really unique. I've already described Cheshire
        and Dalton, which I would describe as small and medium, whereas I'd
        classify Lee as large. Lee had the ultimate strip mall, of Chinese
        restaurant, laundromat, Walgreens. This meant I could do my laundry
        while restocking and seriously stuffing my face. Hiking like this comes
        with having a huge calorie deficit every day, and this would be the day
        that I got the calories back. The
        <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-apple-lee"
          >gracious chinese restaurant</a
        >
        had a section of the menu labelled only as "Super Meals," which of
        course I bought. I ate it so fast that it was the first time I felt pain
        outside of my feet and back on the trip. <br /><br />
        My Walgreens restock finally had me converting to the true hiker diet of
        beef jerky and trail mix. Boy, it is nice. The convenience of not firing
        up the
        <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/114890/msr-pocketrocket-2-stove"
          >Pocket Rocket</a
        >
        I borrowed from my cousin's husband to cook food is seriously
        understated. I think I spent four of the last seven days cooking no
        food. Trail mix is a calorie load, which I didn't really think about
        before hiking. Very good if you like to eat fast, like me.
        <br /><br />
        The ultimate reason why I wanted to stop was for laundry and a shower.
        One of the primary things that I was told prior to hiking was to bring
        no cotton clothes. Personally, I'm so stingy that I didn't want to buy
        new clothes, so I went out with my cotton shirts. Do not do this. At the
        end of every day, I was adding a pound or two to my pack, simply by
        sweating. So I had four incredibly dirty, sweaty, heavy shirts that I
        didn't want to wear. Laundry dropped my weight by about four pounds. And
        showering is something you have to savor. I ended up taking two showers
        in the 18 hour period I was at the hotel. I was to be a very clean boy
        on the trail.
      </p>
      <h2>Reapplying Sweat</h2>
      <p>
        I hiked for another day, before taking another break because the
        following day was to be the hottest of the year at 95 degrees in the
        Berkshires. This day it was 92. I started the day off making about 3
        miles in, to a stand outside someone's house. This stand had some drinks
        and snacks for a small fee, so I picked up a Dr. Pepper. While hanging
        out at the stand, I met the other southbound hiker, named GI. GI is a
        recently retired woman from the White Mountains area of New Hampshire.
        She's really cool. It was really funny meeting another SOBO, because we
        got to share about how we'd met all the same people.
      </p>

        <figcaption>The view from ten feet away from Hawk</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        On this day, we'd meet each other constantly. First, at the AT stand,
        again at the top of Tyringham Cobble, and once more at Shaker Campsite.
        When we met at Tyringham Cobble, we were accompanied by two NOBOs, Salt
        Daddy and Hawk. I previously mentioned Hawk. Over the course of our
        conversation, I slowly began to realize that he was the guy I was told
        about all those days ago. He is the real deal. On his ninth run, Hawk
        was going northbound to meet his girlfriend in Maine, so that next year
        he could do his final trip. Living the dream.
        <br /><br />
        When we met at Shaker, there was a youth group of camp councilors (I
        think), who were hanging out at the camp with tents set up. I knew GI
        was stopping here, and I knew I couldn't stop here, because I didn't
        wanna have to listen to these people talk all night. So I continued up
        Mount Wilcox to the North Mount Wilcox Shelter. This was the hardest
        part of the hike.
        <br /><br />
        Immediately after Shaker, the trail goes up. Wayyyyy up. About 1000 feet
        of elevation. For any regular hiker that isn't bad, but I'm not a
        regular hiker, I'm mildly out of shape. About half way up, there is a
        road, where I hung out for some half an hour. In that time, a single car
        passed by, owned by Christine, a local who supplied me with water, and
        took my name down to post on Facebook to say that she had met me. Also
        on this road, I met a hiker, who gave me some duct tape to finally fix
        my broken Sawyer Squeeze bag.
        <br /><br />
        When I had made it two miles and 700 feet from the campsite, I ran out
        of water. I was so elated to find more after another mile, then I turned
        around and saw a beaver dam. You aren't supposed to drink beaver water,
        for a number of reasons which may be obvious. So, I went off trail, and
        moved up the stream a couple hundred feet and grabbed water from there,
        and then accidentally dunked my foot in.
        <br /><br />
        I got to camp completely drained, and the guy sitting at the table there
        thought there was something wrong with me. I was panting, in a way that
        was comparable to a dog. But to prove I wasn't a dog, I sat down and
        talked to him.
      </p>
      <h2>No Rush and Chopstix</h2>
      <p>
        The man sitting at the table was No Rush The Elder, a retired Alabama
        native, who was on day fifteen of his hike with his partner Chopstix.
        After exchanging the standard hiker pleasantries of asking where you're
        going and where you started, he told me more about their situation.
        <br /><br />
        The two met on the trail early into their hike from Springer a number of
        years ago. They hiked the entirety of the trail together for several
        months. In Massachusetts, Chopstix would severely injure his knee,
        forcing him off the trail. At this time, No Rush also decided to quit
        because he knew he wanted to complete the trail with Chopstix.
        <br /><br />
        After a year of surgery and physical therapy, both got back on the
        trail. It took about 90 miles for Chopstix to get injured again in the
        same place, forcing them off the trail once more. After this, Chopstix
        was told that in order to be comfortable walking again, he would need to
        get his knee replaced. No Rush waited for Chopstix to heal, which led up
        until right now, where the two have been finishing the trail at a pace
        of around eight miles a day. If there were any hikers that I met that I
        truly wanted to make it to Katahdin, it would be these two.
      </p>
      <h2>One More Break Before We Go</h2>
      <p>
        I didn't need a break this day, but my family was worried about me
        hiking in the weather, so I took a short day. I hiked about four miles
        to Beartown State Forest, before catching a shuttle to Great Barrington.
        Previously, I described Cheshire as small, Dalton as medium, and Lee as
        large. That makes Great Barrington Extra Large! Outside of Pittsfield,
        it is the largest city in the Berkshires. And I got the deal of a
        century on a hotel, $70 cash for a room. It was a nice room too, not
        your standard $70 fare.
        <br /><br />
        My shuttle driver's name was Papa Joe. Papa Joe has shuttled for a long
        time, including Chopstix and No Rush, for the last 2 years. All the
        other shuttle drivers told me to talk to him when I hit Great
        Barrington. He also took this funny picture of me when I got dropped
        off:

        <figcaption>Hey, how'd you get this picture!?</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        This day was a lot more chill than when I was in Lee. In Lee, I walked
        nine miles between all the stores for restock and cleaning purposes. In
        Great Barrington, I walked a single mile to buy an entire pizza, went to
        my room, ate it, slept, and left at 8AM the next day, after getting
        McDonalds. It was a unproductive, great day. And I was ready for the
        part where the trail kills me.
      </p>
      <h2>The Part Where the Trail Kills You</h2>
      <p>
        The hardest part of Massachusetts for NOBOs is the start, at Everett.
        Everett is known for being really steep and technical, and similar to
        what the Whites look like in New Hampshire. For SOBOs, the hardest part
        is the other side of this area, Mount Bushnell, and particularly Jug
        End, the first section of it. Wow, these were no joke. Jug End was quite
        rocky, but the view from the top was the best of the whole trip (it's
        the first picture here, see how fast you can scroll!). I hung out here
        for an hour or two, laying around, getting eaten by ants.
        <br /><br />
        Bushnell wasn't much better, but there was no view to get to. In fact,
        FarOut suggests that Bushnell's summit is actually lower than it is. You
        get to the proposed summit, then walk another 0.5 miles. And it's all
        these tiny rocks that kill your feet. After Bushnell, I had to pushnell
        to the next shelter, where I met GI, again, as well as two new guys,
        Ghost Dog and Jolly. This was probably the longest I talked to a group
        of hikers, since we all got there and were set up around 5PM, so there
        was nothing better to do. This would also be the last time I saw GI, as
        she outpaced me after this.
        <br /><br />
        After this day, I hiked down the hard part for NOBOs, on Everett, and
        saw a beautiful view off Race. Race was a very pleasant climb, and at
        the top, you get a 180 degree view off of a cliff for a little under
        half a mile.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Ants from up here.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        I had actually meant to keep pace with GI this day, and make it to
        Brassie Brook Shelter, but I cramped up my knee again, and stopped at
        Sage's Ravine, which was on the other side of Bear Mountain in
        Connecticut. Oh right, I passed into Connecticut.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Never forget where you came from.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h2>Victory Lap</h2>
      <p>
        So, I completed my hike on night eleven, when I got to Sage's Ravine.
        Weirdly, it was my first night alone on a campsite. When I stopped here,
        I actually meant to continue afterward, but I put my sleeping pad down,
        just to lay down for a little bit, and fell asleep within seconds, until
        8PM or so when rain woke me up. I quickly set up my tent and returned
        to sleep.
        <br /><br />
        Waking up, I had my final challenge in front of me, Bear Mountain. For
        reference, on my topographic map, Bear Mountain looked like this /\. It
        was 1000 feet of elevation condensed into about a half a mile. It was my
        first real climb. For the whole time before this, I had carried my water
        bottle in my hand, so I could quickly access it. When I saw Bear, I put
        the water away, because my hands needed to be used. The technical leaps
        and holds you have to do on Bear were probably the most fun I've had on
        the trail, and I was smiling the whole way up (judging from my lazy
        actions up until now, you may not believe this). It seriously was
        incredibly neat, and like I was finally proving myself.
        <br /><br />
        After Bear, it was just cruising into Salisbury, CT. I actually had
        another day before I was getting picked up, so I went a little deeper
        into Connecticut, stayed at camp, saw a deer, went back to Salisbury,
        and ended. My section was over, and now I have to return to regular
        life.
      </p>
      <h2>In The End There Was Norum</h2>
      <p>
        If you were hoping for some deeply introspective message in the end,
        I'll suggest this. One of my primary goals for taking this hike was that
        for a number of years I have felt as though I have no agency or control.
        Everything in your life just sort of happens. Everything has a propensity to feel
        like luck. On the trail, every single thing is your fault. It's the
        ultimate control freak fantasy. I didn't have any major issues, which I
        attribute to pretty much being perfect, but at my worst I tossed my mess
        kit and had to boil SPAM. It was probably my worst meal. Maybe my worst
        meal on- or off-trail.
        <br /><br />
        In any event, the trail gives you all the control you'd ever want. In the woods, you are the most free you will ever be.
