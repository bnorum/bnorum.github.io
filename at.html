        <p>
          Yesterday (June 28th), I completed a section hike which took me from
          North Adams, on the Vermont border of Massachusetts, down to
          Salisbury, on the Massachusetts border of Connecticut. This covers
          about 105 miles of trail and is particularly hilly, though not nearly
          as elevated as other parts of the trail. I'm writing this for the
          clarity and interest of those who have been curious about what I've
          been doing along the way. But before I discuss the trip itself, here
          is a little about my gear.
        </p>

        <h2>Gear</h2>

        <p>
          As seen from my beautiful drawing on the Travelodge notepad, I did in
          fact bring gear. This was my first major trip and I definitely
          overpacked, so I'll go over some staples, and some stuff that was
          useless.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trifecta of sleeping pad, sleeping bag, tent, are some of the most
          important components of your bag, and interestingly the most varied
          among hikers. My set-up is VERY budget friendly, so compared to the
          regular Zpacks and Big Agnes Andys on the trail, I was hauling weight.
          My
          <a
            href="https://www.rei.com/product/217592/rei-co-op-trailmade-20-sleeping-bag"
            >sleeping bag</a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://www.rei.com/product/243610/rei-co-op-trailmade-1-tent-with-footprint"
            >tent</a
          >
          are both REI, and my pad is the cheapest piece of foam on Amazon. I'm
          not even linking it because I've already replaced it. My sleeping pad
          was held on the outside of my pack. It got so, so dirty. Definitely
          pick up something with a cover. Foam is really hard to clean.
          <br /><br />
          Curiously, my pack is also REI, but I bought it off of an old dude on
          marketplace for 50 bucks. It's super old, and lacks a lot of the
          fanciness of modern packs. There's no where to put a water bottle,
          except inside the pack or in your hand. The belts can be hard to
          tighten, as can the cinches. It's also pretty heavy. But it looks
          cool.

          <figcaption>Turns out, everything is just squeezing.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          For my water filter I went with the
          <a href="https://www.sawyer.com/product/squeeze-water-filter-system"
            >Sawyer Squeeze</a
          >. I was treated with a weird kind of respect on the trail for using
          my original pouches that came with the Sawyer, which people tend to
          worry will break on them (remember this). I found the Sawyer to be
          great, and I got used to the taste of water really fast. When I
          started, I actually drank water directly out of the filter, rather
          than putting it in a water bottle first. The technique was a little
          ridiculous, as I had to lift the bag over my head everytime I wanted
          to drink. I, at best, looked like a hydrated idiot. <br /><br />
          My pack ended up being about 33 pounds with food. This comes out to be
          somewhat average for hikers, but I could definitely get down to 30 by
          scrapping some useless stuff. I carried around a shovel for the entire
          time, and only used it once, and brought some pretty sponge-like
          clothes. Shoot for 30, if it's your first trip.
          <br /><br />
          A quick aside before jumping off of gear, just to talk about stuff I
          wish I had. First, a pillow would be nice, I've heard good things
          about a couple brands, particularly the
          <a
            href="https://www.nemoequipment.com/products/fillo-backpacking-pillow"
            >Nemo Fillo</a
          >
          and the
          <a
            href="https://cascadedesigns.com/products/compressible-pillow-cinch"
            >Thermarest Compressible</a
          >. I've never actually tried out a camp pillow, so I have to do that
          to figure out if they're worth it, but my hope is that they feel good.
          I also found myself jealous of other people's bags regularly, so I'll
          be looking into ways to modify my current one to better suit my needs.

        <h2>First Days</h2>

        <p>
          Turns out, backpacking while unprepared is actually pretty hard. I
          gave myself a period of about two weeks to train, and went for day
          hikes of around five miles every other day. This was not enough. I was
          about half of a mile into my hike, when I was positive I was going to
          quit (I didn't).
          <br /><br />
          The first day was particularly hard. I travelled about ten miles (more
          than I had ever hiked ever, probably), and got up to a ledge on
          Prospect (seen above). Following this, I went twenty minutes in the
          wrong direction, and ended up getting to camp at around 9PM. Whoops.
          This was by far my quietest day. It seems the bubble of hikers from
          Springer had not reached my area yet, and I wouldn't see hikers in
          droves until a little under a week in, when I would reach Upper Goose
          Pond.
          <br /><br />
          After the first day I woke up to rain. This weather would make day two
          end very short. I travelled a little over four miles. I have a lot of
          excuses for this, I swear. First, yesterday was a lot of mileage for
          someone as out of shape as me. Second, this was Williams and Greylock,
          the highest elevation in Massachusetts. Third, it was pouring. Along
          the way, I would meet a few people. First was two old women who gave
          me some water and a hard boiled egg. Thanks! Second was a guy who I
          had seen doing a day hike the day prior, and would see day hiking on
          day 3 as well, which was odd. Third was my first hiker-hiker, named No
          Filter.
          <br /><br />
          No Filter and I met at the emergency shelter at the top of Greylock.
          He was in his 50s, and from Malden (which he didn't need to tell me, I
          knew). We both got stuck at the top of Greylock, because the rain was
          too hard to safely get down. In an attempt to make the most of it, we
          started a fire in the fireplace in the emergency shelter. No Filter
          may well have been a wizard, because I swear the wood was wet when I
          got in there. At this point, we also found toilet paper and vodka very
          handy. For fire, not for food and drink. The fire raised the
          temperatures in the shelter just enough to almost dry my wet clothes.

        <p>
          Greylock was very complicated for me. For a lot of people, it's the
          highlight of Massachusetts, for me, it kind of blew. When I got to the
          top, I was relived and excited to get to the lodge, only to find out
          it was closed, which is how me and No Filter ended up in the emergency
          shelter. We made the most of it, but Greylock's characteristic views
          couldn't be seen. The best part was the next morning, when the lodge
          opened and they served breakfast, which was great and cheap. There, I
          would meet my first thru hiker, Kaleidoscope. He was crazy, telling us
          about his consistent 25-30 mile days. He was a few days ahead of the
          rest of the bubble, so it was clear that his mileage was adding up. I
          would also go on to see him in every subsequent hiker log I checked
          going southbound. He signs his name in rainbow pen.
          <br /><br />
          It was also on Greylock where I would recieve my trail name, after the
          previously mentioned old women and No Filter seperately suggested that
          the location I hold my towel (see drawing above) was reminiscent of a
          sumo wrestler. Hence the name: Sumo.
          <br /><br />
          Leaving Greylock about a mile in, I cramped my knee, really bad. I was
          able to limp about half of a mile to a street. Luckily, there is a
          large network of shuttle drivers in the Berkshires ready to pick you
          up within an hour. I got picked up by Cindy, an old woman driving a
          Subaru with a busted manifold, who was still managing to go 60 in a
          30. She dropped me off where I would camp next, so I effectively
          missed about five miles of the trail from Greylock to Cheshire. She,
          along with all of the shuttle drivers I would go on to meet, are
          experts in the surrounding area, both in regards to hiking, as well as
          everything else. If you needed any kind of item, they could take you
          to where it is sold.
          <br /><br />
          Father Tom's Campsite, where I spent the remainder of day three, was a
          very nice campsite situated in the center of the puny town of
          Cheshire. Cheshire has three attractions, a gas station, a Dollar
          General, and a restaurant. The campsite, kept together by a local
          church, had several amenities, including bikes. I'm confident the bike
          fixed my knee. I could barely walk so I biked everywhere, and biked
          for leisure. It was a lot of fun.
          <br /><br />
          I also ate at a restaurant! This quickly became one of my favorite
          things on the trail (some dedicated hikers hate it). Stopping and
          eating is incredibly satisfying here, because every calorie counts,
          and you get to experience a little bit of local life. It was here I
          made a habit of getting a beer in every town I'm in.
        </p>
        <h2>Dalton and Beyond</h2>
        <p>
          After a bit of hiking and a brief stop at Crystal Mountain campsite, I
          had made it to Dalton without any major issues. Dalton is sick. I
          somehow came out of town spending twenty dollars, after getting a
          burger, fries, two beers, two Smartwaters, some chips, and ice cream. I
          don't know how this happened. I unfortunately missed a legend, Tom
          Levardi, who is a notorious trail angel whose house is on the trail.
          He was out to lunch. I did, however, meet a group at the bar, who were
          headed up to Vermont that day (!!), about a 25 mile distance, at 2PM.
          I don't get how some do it.
